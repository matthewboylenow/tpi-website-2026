# Taylor Products Brand & Tone Guide

## Brand Voice

Taylor Products is a family business that's been helping local operators succeed since 1985. Our voice is **warm, practical, and genuine**—like talking to a trusted neighbor who happens to know everything about commercial equipment.

## Tone Guidelines

### Do This → Avoid This

| Do This | Avoid This |
|---------|------------|
| "We help you make money" | "Profit solutions" |
| "When your freezer goes down" | "Equipment downtime scenarios" |
| "You can tell he truly cares" | "Customer-centric approach" |
| "Let's find your machine" | "Discover our equipment portfolio" |
| "Come visit our showroom" | "Schedule a facility tour" |
| "We answer the phone" | "Industry-leading response times" |
| "Built to last" | "Superior durability metrics" |
| "Kids love it" | "Appeals to younger demographics" |

### Key Principles

1. **Talk like a person** - No corporate jargon. Write like you're explaining something to a friend.
2. **Focus on outcomes** - Don't talk about features; talk about what those features mean for the customer's business.
3. **Be specific** - "40 years" is better than "decades of experience"
4. **Show personality** - It's okay to be a little playful ("Kids love it, operators love the profits")
5. **Be honest** - We're not the cheapest. We're the partner who helps you succeed.

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Would I say this to a customer face-to-face?
- [ ] Does it sound like a person or a brochure?
- [ ] Am I talking about what they care about (their business) or what we care about (our features)?
- [ ] Is there a simpler way to say this?
- [ ] Would my mom understand it?
